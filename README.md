# Hands On Cloud Migration for Managers

## Abstract
The cloud is a highly technical, constantly evolving space. To keep up, managers
try to cobble together countless cloud concepts from power point slides and
cartoons that provide incomplete abstractions. Consequently, their understanding
is rarely sufficient for meaningful decision making. This workshop aims to
remedy this situation by giving participants the opportunity to perform a real
cloud migration on an archetypal business application (no coding skills
required).

The workshop starts with a typical business application running on a local
machine. All participants will be divided into one of six groups, and each group
will be responsible for migrating the application to the cloud. A global
dashboard will track the state of each team's application and correlate
management objectives to tangible technical tasks. Expect to gain a ground truth
conception of the cloud while enjoying lighthearted fun.
